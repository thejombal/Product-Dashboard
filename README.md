# Product Dashboard
## Product Dashboard Abstract

The Product Dashboard project was initially a school project in my Info Systems class. We were tasked with taking the dataset and creating visualization on interesting trends in the data. The dataset consisted of body care products, location of particular items sold, and its profit/sales. Having completed the project, my professor had reached out to me for permission to use the video as a class example for many semesters to come. The video has since gained 4000+ views: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQp6Cq4S4CU. 

With the success of my presentation, this garnered the attention of the USF Executive Council and I went on to present in front of the Executive Board, which included both university and corporate executives. I was then asked to present at the Florida Business Analytics forum, which had 300+ members in attendance.
